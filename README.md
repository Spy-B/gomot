## It's an Advanced Godot Framework

This is a **Godot Engine** Framework, it should be fully customizable so that the games that will be made using this framework will look totally different from each other.

## Errors after installing
after installing the framework there will be some issues you need to fix in the **Project Settings** (Autoload, Input Map...)

### Fixing the Globals (Autoload)
first of all you should add the **Global** Script to the autoload go to ```Project > Project Settings > Globals```

* press on the folder icon to choose the file path

<p align="center"><img width="85%" height="auto" alt="Screenshot From 2025-08-10 00-14-24" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7047bd4-c51e-4d3c-abe3-2c070a25e809" /></p>

* find the **Global** Script, it should be in ```res://Scripts/Global.gd```, and then Open it

<p align="center"><img width="85%" height="auto" alt="Screenshot From 2025-08-10 00-18-03" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f7ce137-3a99-4d61-8b3c-0a8aeb10d5bb" /></p>

* after that you should click on **[Add]**

> [!Warning]
> don't change the **Node Name**

<p align="center"><img width="85%" height="auto" alt="Screenshot From 2025-08-10 00-58-03" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b97c238-3e8d-4b3d-a451-93b7532974d7" /></p>

and that's it, now it should be right here
<p align="center"><img width="85%" height="auto" alt="Screenshot From 2025-08-10 00-21-16" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/911f2449-94be-43b4-b11e-c38859588aa2" /></p>


### Fixing the Inputs
Go to ```Project > Input Map``` and then add the following actions and assign them to the keys you want

```move_right, move_left, move_up, move_down, run, jump, reload, shoot, attack, pause, restart, interact, continue, dash, super```

click on **Add New Action**, then write its name and click on Add, and reapet it with every other action

<p align="center"><img width="85%" height="auto" alt="Screenshot From 2025-08-10 00-54-56" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0aaacdbf-d0a6-46cc-b551-af7268d5fc71" /></p>

### Fixing the window Settings
* first you have to go to the Window Settings under Display, and don't forget to check this button **[Advanced Settings]**
<p align="center"><img width="85%" height="auto" alt="Screenshot From 2025-08-10 16-42-44" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8d26799-9ade-4c27-8965-59d3944951bc" /></p>

* Now you should see new settings appear, just copy the following settings to your project and of course you can customize them the way you want.
  #### Size:
	```Viewport Width: 1920```
	
	```Viewport Height: 1080```
	
	```Mode: Exclusive Fullscreen``` **(It's a must if you gonna export your game for Phones or Tablets)**
	
	```Resizable: false``` (Optional)
	
	```Window Width Override: 960``` (This Setting will not effect the final game)
	
	```Window Height Override: 540``` (This Setting will not effect the final game)
	
  #### Stretch:
	```Mode: viewport``` (this is the best option for **2D Games**)
	
	```Aspect: expand``` (this option will expand your window to fit your screen, **It's a must if you gonna export your game for Phones or Tablets**)
	
  #### Handheld:
	```Orientation: Sensore Landscape``` (for Phones)
